								<h2>Professional experience</h2>
								<p>As a programming intern at Tritech, I developed my skills in REACT.JS, as well as Kotlin and Java for backend. I understood corporate culture, tickets, assignments, and how software is handled at a bigger picture. I worked in the API's, and learned more about Postman as well as code flow. I tested bugs and made spreadsheets for easier account management. I also worked with the multiple environments' databases, taking my PostgresSQL skills up a notch. I had a blast, and can't wait to learn more!</p>
								<p>As ThinkTank programming lead, I led the programming team for the Prodigier project, creating AI for Von Neumann probes to track routes, identify minerals, and manage data with advanced celestial navigation and redundant systems. I evaluated communication methods such as X-Band, Ka-Band, high-gain antennas, and emerging technologies like laser and quantum communication to enhance data transfer. Additionally, I contributed to developing the universal constructor and probe functionality, focusing on navigation and data storage for deep-space exploration. </p>
								<h2>More things coming!</h2>
								<p>I am so grateful for the opportunity to work with decision based modeling systems for the early detection and management of Bovine Respiratory Disease. To build on my existing skills in ML in a field that is not computer science will allow me to grow as a software engineer. Stay tuned for big updates this semester!.</p>
